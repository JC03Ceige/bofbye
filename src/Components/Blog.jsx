                <strong>Did you know</strong>, the relationship between bees and
                humans is one of the oldest in recorded history? With evidence
                from cave paintings to discoveries of wax, honey and bee rearing
                from ancient dig sites. It doesn't end there though, mythology
                and ancient rituals are rife with examples of the importance
                that bees have played in our lives from the earliest of times.
                In modern times, for most of us, bees are the cute (from a
                distance) insects that roam our gardens and buzz around the
                spring blooms and blossoms. We enjoy their labor in our everyday
                life through the honey which, let's face it, adds decadence to
                just about anything, and the magnificent beeswax that we enjoy
                in everything from cosmetics to medicine. The Khoi-San have a
                fantastical story of a bee that carried a mantis accross a
                river. When they were halway accross, the bee was too exhausted
                to carry on and softly rested the mantis on a flower, gently
                floating by. Before the bee exhaled its last breath, it planted
                a seed inside the mantis, which eventually grew to become the
                first ever human. In Egyptian mythology, bees came into
                existence when the Egyptian sun god, Ra, started weeping, and as
                his tears fell onto the scorching desert sand, they transformed
                into bees. There are countless stories like these from all
                cultures and civilisations in history, going to show just how
                much bees have been prickling our interest and captivating our
                imaginations throughout the ages.

                But, seeing as today is National Garden Day in South Africa,
                asking oursleves 'How much do we really know about these garden
                dwellers?' is a fair question. Bees are extremely fascinating
                creatures and they are as diverse and multi faceted as the
                humans that have been intrigued by them throughout history. For
                instance, did you know that there are over 20 000 bee species
                worldwide, and 3 000 of them can be found right here on the
                African continent!? From soil tunneling bees, leafcutter bees,
                the honeybees (which we all know, and some of us love) to
                stingless bees. Yup, you read right, stingless. These critters
                don't seperate their honey, pollen and brood cells as the
                honeybees do, making them not ideal for honey extraction. It's
                probably better this way because even though they don't sting,
                they have some pretty nasty mandables to bite any unwitting
                intruders with. Then we have the placid Italian bees. Some go as
                far as to describe them as having a 'gentle nature', not
                something that we in South Africa are familiar with. From 1930
                to 1965, Dr. Arnold E. Lundie imported Italian bees at
                irregeluar intervals, but none of his attempts took flight as
                they never became established. The African worker bees continued
                to dominate and eventually the Italian colonies became a thing
                of dreams and desires.

                Jump back to 2022 and the two predominant species in the South
                Africa are the African bee and the Cape Honey Bee. The Cape
                Honey Bee is quite spectacular, in that the worker bees are able
                to reproduce through thelytokous pathenogenisis (don't worry, I
                can also not pronounce thelosdfjsdj pdafjdsk). This means they
                are able to requeen themselves. In the Cape Honey Bee colonies,
                between 30% to 70% of the worker bees have what it takes to do
                the 'birds and the bees', compared to other species that have
                less than 2%. I'd say that is pretty remarkable. But enough
                about the birds and the bees. Exactly why are bees so
                significant to the brilliantly diverse flora we have in South
                Africa? It is fairly common knowledge that bees play an immensly
                important role in pollination. For those who need a crash
                course, pollination is when the pollen from a male flower is
                delivered to a female flower, allowing the female to grow and
                develop the seeds which ensures the continuation of the specie
                as well as the magnificance of our gardens. This is not
                something that bees do intentionally. Instictively, bees only
                visit the same type of flower during each flight. They tiny
                litte hairs on their tiny little hind legs which collectects the
                pollen when the bee nestles to feast on the nectar provided by
                the flowers. Okay, saying they feast on the nectar is a
                fancifull reimagining of them collecting it to produce honey,
                but let's be honest, it sounds much more romantic. As we can
                conclude from this, the pollen collection is not at all
                intentional but one of the most important mechanisms in nature.
                The fact that bees only visit the same type of flower during
                each flight also prolifically increases the odds of succesfull
                polination and helps protect the precious biodiversity of our
                flora. In European countries and in Isreal, they use bublebees
                in greenhouses because, remarkably, they can visit a variety of
                flowers during a single flight. This is obviously not ideal,
                because not only will this effect the biodiversity of our flora
                but they can also be invasive, adversely affecting the locals.
                Certain bee species have also evolved to pollinate specific
                flower species, making them quite indespensible to the granduous
                gardens we have enjoyed throughout history.

                Sadly, the bee population have been dwindling worldwide due to a
                variety of factors. According to the Food and Agriculture
                Organisation of the UN, bees (and other pollinators) are
                responsible for 35% of the world's crop pollination. But it
                doesn't end there, they are not solely responsible for the food
                that we eat but also for the pollination of medicinal plants
                and, of course, the glorious gardens that we are celebrating
                today. Bees are one the hardest working critters on the planet
                and there is so much more to them than just honey and beeswax.
                We have been feasting and foraging their exceptional products
                from the dawn of time and enjoying their gentle buzz in our
                gardens probably from when horticulture first became a popular
                pastime. So, on this National Garden Day, let's celebrate these
                unbelievable little garden helpers along with our beautiful
                gardens.{" "}
